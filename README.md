# Collision Simulation

A C++ elastic and inelastic simulation with two spherical objects.
The compressive properties in the program were experimentally determined by weights
and a force sensor. These compressive properties were of a generic stress ball. 

The output of this program is an excel file with all of the data. A graphical representation
is not provided.
